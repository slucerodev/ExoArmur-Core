# ExoArmur Open-Core Boundary Definition

**Version: v1.0.0-beta - Phase 6 Certified**

## 🚨 RUNTIME & ARTIFACTS POLICY

### Repository Hygiene
- **data/**: NATS JetStream runtime state - generated locally, excluded from Git
- **artifacts/reality_run_**/**: Evidence bundles - reproducible, not stored in Git  
- **__pycache__/**, *.pyc: Python bytecode - excluded from Git
- **.venv/**: Virtual environments - excluded from Git
- **logs/**: Runtime logs - excluded from Git

### Evidence Bundle Policy
- No reality_run evidence bundles are committed to Git
- Evidence is regenerated deterministically via `scripts/phase6_final_reality_run.py`
- Repository may contain only empty placeholder directories or documentation examples outside runtime paths
- All evidence bundles are reproducible from source code

### Reproducibility Guarantee
- All evidence bundles can be regenerated via `scripts/phase6_final_reality_run.py`
- Runtime state is recreated automatically on fresh execution
- Phase 6 verification is fully reproducible from source
- Repository remains lean while preserving complete audit trail

## BOUNDARY DEFINITION

### What Defines "Core"
1. **Production-Ready**: Components required for production deployment
2. **OSS Dependencies**: Uses open-source Python dependencies declared in requirements files
3. **Runtime Requirements**: Requires NATS JetStream for Golden Demo and Phase 6 verification
4. **No Proprietary Dependencies**: No paid or commercial dependencies in core
5. **Well-Documented**: Complete documentation and examples
6. **Fully Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage
7. **Stable API**: No breaking changes between versions
8. **Truth Enforcement**: Contains all verification and testing infrastructure

### What Defines "Excluded"
1. **Internal Tools**: Tools for internal development only
2. **Commercial Features**: Revenue-generating capabilities
3. **Third-party IP**: Components with licensing restrictions
4. **Non-Essential**: Features not required for core functionality
5. **Organizational Infrastructure**: CI/CD, secrets, internal systems

### Experimental Repository Boundary
- Experimental components do NOT exist inside the core repository
- Experimental work lives in a separate repository, branch, or explicitly gated distribution
- The core repo contains only production-truth components
- No experimental code directories exist in core repository structure

## VERIFICATION

### Core Component Verification
```bash
# Verify all core components are present and functional
python3 scripts/phase6_final_reality_run.py

# Expected: All gates GREEN, all tests PASS
```

### Boundary Compliance Check
```bash
# Verify no experimental components in core release
find src/ -name "*.py" | grep -v "__pycache__" | wc -l
# Expected: Only core components present

# Verify no evidence bundles in Git
git ls-files | grep "artifacts/reality_run_"
# Expected: No output (no tracked evidence bundles)

# Verify documentation completeness
ls docs/ | grep -E "(reliability|auth|audit|replay)"
# Expected: All core components documented
```

### Release Integrity Check
```bash
# Verify release bundle integrity
python3 -m tests.test_phase6_timeout_simple
python3 -m tests.test_phase6_retry_minimal
python3 -m tests.test_phase6_backpressure_minimal
python3 -m tests.test_phase6_circuit_breaker_minimal

# Expected: All tests pass without additional dependencies
```
