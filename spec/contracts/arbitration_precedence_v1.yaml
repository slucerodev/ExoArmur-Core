    Defines deterministic precedence rules for resolving conflicts between
    kill switches, policy authorization, safety gating, trust constraints,
    and collective confidence. This is the definitive arbitration order
    applied by every cell.

  arbitration_order:
    - level: 1
      name: KillSwitch
      description: >
        Global or tenant kill switches override everything. Only A0 observe
        may proceed if any kill switch is active.
      outcome_priority: "deny"

    - level: 2
      name: PolicyVerification
      description: >
        If policy bundle is missing/invalid/unverified, execution beyond A0
        is prohibited; escalate per severity ladder (typically require_quorum).
      outcome_priority: "escalate_or_deny"

    - level: 3
      name: SafetyGate
      description: >
        Safety gate verdict overrides decision engine and policy allowance.
        Safety can deny or require escalation even if policy allows.
      outcome_priority: "deny_or_escalate"

    - level: 4
      name: PolicyAuthorization
      description: >
        Policy determines what actions are allowed and what approvals are required.
        Policy cannot force execution; it only authorizes.
      outcome_priority: "deny_or_require_approval"

    - level: 5
      name: TrustConstraints
      description: >
        Trust modifies autonomy. Low trust can prohibit A2/A3 local execution even
        if confidence is high, forcing quorum/human gate.
      outcome_priority: "escalate"

    - level: 6
      name: CollectiveConfidence
      description: >
        Determines if quorum and aggregate_score thresholds are satisfied for A2/A3
        (unless local-confidence exception is allowed by policy/safety).
      outcome_priority: "escalate"

    - level: 7
      name: LocalDecision
      description: >
        Local decision proposes intents and confidence. Used after all higher-level
        constraints are satisfied.
      outcome_priority: "allow_if_all_above_satisfied"

  tie_breakers:
    - name: ConflictDetected
      rule: >
        If conflict_detected=true then prohibit A3 unless human-approved.
        Allow only reversible A1 containment if safety allows; otherwise escalate.
    - name: DegradedMode
      rule: >
        In degraded_mode=true, restrict to severity ladder defaults and require
        escalation for A2/A3 unless explicitly policy-authorized and safety-allowed.

  canonical_statement:
    policy_authorizes_safety_permits: >
      Policy authorizes actions. Safety permits actions. If either denies,
      the action does not execute. Quorum/human gates satisfy approval conditions
      but never override safety denials.
